<h1>Welcome to My App: Weather Dashboard.</h1>

<h3>This repo houses my Weather Dashboard application. I've created a web app that displays a search bar with the ability to look up a city and then the page will display the weather forecast for said city.</h3>

<p>Here as you can see, I've searched up Perth and the output is the current day and forecast displayed at the top along with the next 5 day forecast proceeding afterwards.</p>
